# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

## Installation
npm install

# Start the development server with:
npm run dev

## NOTE
Make sure you have the proper .env file

# Additional Notes
The application includes a backend built with Node.js and Express for handling user authentication and booking management.
Material-UI is used for designing the components to ensure a consistent and professional look.
Redux is used for state management, and Redux Persist is used to persist the state across sessions.
